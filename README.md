Project for my Object-Oriented Programming course

<b>File Splitter</b>
<p>This program takes one file as input and divide it following different split routines </p>
 <ul>
 	<li>By default it divides file by a frame size taken as input</li>
  <li>Divide file in N parts </li>
  <li>Divide file by specifying the dimension of each part </li>
</ul>

The parts can be merged together later in a single file.

The program can also zip and crypt the generated parts, for encryption is used the google tink library
